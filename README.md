# ChucKDesigner

[ChucK](https://chuck.stanford.edu/) + [TouchDesigner](https://derivative.ca/)

ChucKDesigner is an integration of the ChucK music/audio programming language with the TouchDesigner visual programming language. ChucKDesigner is similar in spirit to [Chunity](https://chuck.stanford.edu/chunity/), the combination of ChucK and the Unity game engine. With ChucKDesigner, TouchDesigner can control ChucK code via user interfaces and channel operator streams. TouchDesigner can also fetch audio streams and float variables from ChucK. Eventually, there will be support for sharing other variables such as bools, integers, and more special cases of arrays bidirectionally between TouchDesigner and ChucK. ChucKDesigner is supported on Windows and will have MacOS support soon.
